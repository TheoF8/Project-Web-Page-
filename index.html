      <p> 
        As life expectancy increases further into old age, neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s are becoming a major health concern in the modern 
        all around the world. Early detection is crucial but interpreting complex brain scans is a demanding task. In our semester project, we investigated how 
        deep learning, specifically Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE), can help classify MRI and PET scans to detect Alzheimer's.
        Using the ADNI dataset, we trained our model to recognize the subtle patterns in brain images that correlate with the disease. Our approach combines 
        representation learning and image compression to extract key features from medical scans — and then uses them to power an Alzheimer’s classifier.
        This blog showcases our methodology, results, and key insights. We hope it demonstrates the potential of machine learning in advancing neuroimaging 
        and medical diagnosis. <br>
        Below, we will present our findings regarding the use of Vq-Vae architecture in diagnosing Alzheimer disease.
